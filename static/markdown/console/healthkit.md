# Healthkit

Apple Healthkit does not require authorization tokens.  There are no OAuth tokens or secret required for connecting an iOS application to Healthkit.  The iOS device manages Healthkit permissions at the time a user connects Healthkit.

The Healthkit option will only be available in our [iOS SDK](/guides/mobile-ios) as an option users to for connect via their mobile device.  Healthkit requires the use of our [iOS SDK](/guides/mobile-ios) and will not be viewable during access from any other connection screen.
