# Getting Started with Strap Connect

Strap Connect allows developers to easily integrate wearables into their existing mobile applications, enabling powerful new connections from fitness and health data to existing business logic.

There are two main components of Connect.

1. The mobile SDK's that developers integrate into mobile apps to enable access to an end user's wearable or fitness data. Mobile SDK's are currently available for iOS and Android applications.
2. A reports API for retrieving data related to a user's connected devices.
