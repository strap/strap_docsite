# Getting Started with Strap Mobile SDKs

Strap Mobile SDKs allows developers to easily integrate wearables into their existing mobile applications, enabling powerful new connections from fitness and health data to existing business logic.

## How does it work?

1. **ENABLE YOUR EXISTING MOBILE APPS** <br />Take our software development kit for iOS and Android and integrate with a variety of fitness tracking and smart watch platforms from a single interface.
2. **LET CUSTOMERS CONNECT** <br />Empower your users to bring their own device. Strap works across platforms so no wearable is left out.
3. **USER LINK THEIR ACCOUNT TO YOUR APP** <br />Customer authorizes your app on their account.
4. **PROVIDE PERSONAL METRICS** <br />With our robust logic engine, you can display customer information in a common format, even if the information originally came from a combination of fitness trackers and smart watches.

## Mobile SDKs

Developers integrate our SDK into mobile apps to enable access to an end user's wearable or fitness data. Mobile SDKs are currently available for iOS and Android applications.
